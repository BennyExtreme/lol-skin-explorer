The first formal release of Skin Explorer! This is pretty much a complete
rewrite of the alpha version that was [initially posted to r/leagueoflegends](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r7c0ir/i_made_skin_explorer_an_online_skin_splash_art/), with a ton of new features.

- Pre-rework splash art, all the way back to patch 7.1!
- Skin universes to group related skinlines.
- Supports Add to Home Screen (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) and Install (Desktop Chrome).
- More aggressive caching of resources to keep app snappy.
- Touch- and mobile-friendly.
- Statically rendered and SEO optimized.
- Many QoL enhancements throughout.
